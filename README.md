## Simple Commerce Starter Kit

<!-- /statamic:hide -->

Inspired by [Peak](https://github.com/studio1902/statamic-peak), the Simple Commerce Starter Kit is a great starting point to build bespoke e-commerce sites.

You can either build on top of the Starter Kit or use it as reference for your project. It includes a full checkout flow, including shipping selection, payment via on-site & off-site gateways.

Please remember to purchase a license from the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/simple-commerce) before using Simple Commerce in production.

## Features

-   Minimal design
-   Step by step checkout process
-   Built with TailwindCSS and Alpine.js
-   Demonstrates Simple Commerce functionality
-   Supports both standalone and variant products
-   Includes basic product filtering

## Quick Start

You can quickly create a new site using the [Statamic CLI](https://github.com/statamic/cli).

```
statamic new artisan-bakery duncanmcclean/sc-starter-kit
```

**And that should be you setup! ðŸŽ‰**

## Front-end stack

Tailwind CSS & Alpine.js are used out-of-the-box but feel free to change them out if you're more comfortable with something else. For building CSS & JS, this starter kit uses [Vite](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/vite). It's configured to compile one CSS file and one JS file.

-   `resources/css/site.css` -> `public/css/site.css`
-   `resources/js/site.js` -> `public/js/site.js`

There's also a few commands you can run to compile your assets for various environments.

-   `npm run dev` - runs a local watcher
-   `npm run build` - to build your CSS & JavaScript, ready for production

## Inspired by Peak

Parts of the Simple Commerce Starter Kit have been inspired/borrowed from the popular [Peak starter kit](https://github.com/studio1902/statamic-peak). If you're not familiar with Peak, I'd highly recommend checking it out.

If you want to use all the features in Peak, you should install the Peak Starter Kit first, then [install Simple Commerce on top](https://simple-commerce.duncanmcclean.com/installation#content-installing-into-an-existing-site).
